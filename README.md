# Icarus ERC20 Memecoin

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the Icarus ERC20 Memecoin.

## Description

$ICARUS is a new type of memecoin based on the ERC20 standard. It is the first of its kind; a "Doomcoin" featuring a built-in self-destruction protocol that will allow its destruction after 2.600.000 blocks unless a total of 1 million transactions are reached. Let's help avoid its destruction together so that $ICARUS may live forever!

If the Doomsday Block is reached without surpassing 1 million transactions, any user will be able to pause the contract forever and claim the ETH it holds. 

## How to buy

1. Create a Wallet: download Metamask or your wallet of choice from the app store or google play store for free. For desktop users: download the Google Chrome extension by going to metamask.io.
2. Get some ETH: have ETH in your wallet to switch to $ICARUS. If you don’t have any ETH, you can buy directly on Metamask, transfer from another wallet, or buy on another exchange and send it to your wallet.
3. Connect to Uniswap: Go to app.uniswap.org in Google Chrome or the  Metamask app. Connect your wallet. Paste the $ICARUS token address into Uniswap, select Icarus, and confirm. Sign with Metamask.
4. Switch ETH for $ICARUS: there are NO taxes of any kind, so you don’t need to worry about buying with a specific slippage, although you may need to use slippage during times of market volatility.

## Tokenomics

Total supply: 149,597,870,700

Taxes: NONE

80.00% of the tokens were sent to the liquidity pool. LP tokens will be burnt and the contract will be renounced once the project is up and running. 10,00% were sent to Daedalus, the creator of the project. The remaining 10.00% of the supply is being held in a wallet only to be used as tokens for future centralized exchange listings, bridges, and liquidity pools. This wallet is easily trackable with the ENS name “icaruscexwallet.eth”.
